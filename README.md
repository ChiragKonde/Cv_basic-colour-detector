# Cv_basic-colour-detector
This project utilizes OpenCV to detect and isolate specific colors within an image. By converting the image to the HSV color space, the project identifies colors based on predefined ranges. The color detection algorithm highlights the specified color within the image, providing a visual representation of the detected color regions.
